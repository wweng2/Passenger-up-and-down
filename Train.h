  //        adds a new car and inserts the passenger in the first open car starting at the front.
  //        Also, displays name and final destination of passenger being loaded.

  //        destination. If they are, the passenger is removed from the train.
  // Note - Deallocate the passenger first then you can use the m_passengers.erase command.

  // added a car to hold 17 passengers and one disembarks, do not remove it)
  // Preconditions - Passengers reach their destination

  //        reached last stop, indicates this.
  //        When at end, also recommends turning train around.
  // Preconditions - Valid train on valid route

  // Name: TurnTrainAround()
  // Desc - When chosen from the menu at the end of the route, reverses the Route by

  //        than maximum capacity
